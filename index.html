                 <p> Becoming a Web Developer, should have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
                    It's also recommended to learn about CSS and CSS frameworks.<br>
                     Developing these fundamental web development skills will give the foundation<br> and logic for communicating with programming languages.</p>

            <p>Web developers provide businesses with the unique, engaging websites they need to connect with customers.<br>
                 While businesses could feasibly create their own sites using Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress templates,<br>
                  these tend to look amateurish and run slowly compared to sites built by professional Web Developers</p>
